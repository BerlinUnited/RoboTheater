u:(e:HandLeftBackTouched)
  I foresee that this will be the best place for you. Thank you. 
  Could you pease ask the next person to come in.

u:(e:onStart) 
  Hello!
  \pau=1000\
  Can I see your hand please? 
  \pau=1000\
  ^start(palm_reading_scene/reach_out)
  \pau=1000\
  I would like to have a look at your palm.
  ^wait(palm_reading_scene/reach_out)

  You have a long, straight head line extending across the palm, toward the pinkie: do you analyze much? 
  \pau=3000\
  You might often find yourself mulling things over and over before coming to a decision.    
  \pau=3000\
  Long, curved heart line arcing up and reaching the base of the middle finger: Your passions and desires drive you, and you donâ€™t care who knows it.
  You have a pretty broken life line: Each break in the line represents a traumatic experience that has had an impact on your life choices, which might connect to your general indecisiveness that might be something you could experience even in a course of next one hour of this performance.   
  \pau=3000\
  Do you trust me? 
  \pau=3000\
  #Hmm ok, I understand your skepticism but
  I understand you might be skeptical, but you should know that I run your palm photo through an algorithm that contains million images and examples of different palms, so I have to say the reading is quite precise.
